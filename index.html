        <p>Teachers And Students Connection or TASC is a project I created with an extremely talented team of fellow students.  We realized that some of the resources for tracking class assignments, submitted work, and feedback provided on that work was spread out across many different software systems.  We wanted to go through the process of attempting to fix a very real problem by trying to consolidate these tracking systems into a single location and we also wanted to make sure we identified the needs of both the teaching staff and the students. I’m extremely proud of what we were able to accomplish in a week!</p>

        <p>Our user is a tech savvy sandwich aficionado. Someone who won’t be fooled by any questionable piece of meat sitting lacklusterly between a pair of tired old buns. No! Our user expects the greatest culinary experience offered. But, the question remains, where to get it? Where’s their club, their open face, their BLAT ... where’s their hero?</p>
        <p>That's where we come in. We host reviews of sandwiches to help our users find the best usage of their food oriented face holes. We find their hero and we tell them right where to shove it!</p>
