              <p>Teachers And Students Connecting or TASC is a project I created with an extremely talented team of fellow students.  We realized that some of our web development school's resources for tracking class assignments, submitted work, and feedback provided on that work was spread out across many different software systems.  We wanted to go through the process of attempting to fix a very real problem by trying to consolidate these tracking systems into a single location and we also wanted to make sure we identified the needs of both the teaching staff and the students. I’m extremely proud of what we were able to accomplish in a week!</p>

              <p>My role on the team was that of a team member wearing many hats.  I created controllers, models, and views providing the ability to create, read, update, and destroy resources.  I also worked to ensure that these options were displayed on the screen in a way that was not only clear, but worked within the general style of our school, General Assembly, specifically because we wanted the site to resemble a school resource and we chose to follow their style guidelines rather than making something that looked and felt like a separate experience.  Lasty, relying on previous work experience, I helped by functioning as a supervising project manager allowing other team members to stretch their legs at creating the schedule, breaking down tasks and communicating needs and I tried to speak up minimally to call attention to potential risks I had identified and help the group work to achieve a solution before the problem arose in full.  I’m extremely proud of what our team accomplished in such a short period of time and I’m very proud of my contributions with the group.</p>

              <p>Our user is a tech savvy sandwich aficionado. Someone who won’t be fooled by any questionable piece of meat sitting lacklusterly between a pair of tired old buns. No! Our user expects the greatest culinary experience offered. But, the question remains, where to get it? Where’s their club, their open face, their BLAT ... where’s their hero?</p>
              <p>That's where we come in. We host reviews of sandwiches to help our users find the best usage of their food oriented face holes. We find their hero and we tell them right where to shove it!</p>

              <p>This was a wonderful project I completed early in the class as an introduction into database work and API integration.  I really enjoyed pushing myself to increase the functionality of the google map integration.  I also relished an opportunity to try and create a truly memorable review experience and I think that the personality that the gifs add to the reviews does a lot to enhance the at a glance value of each of our reviews.</p>

              <p>In 4 days I was able to create a project I feel very proud of. I devised a plan with contingencies, researched new technologies, was able to successfully re-evaluate my plan after days of research and with the 4 days remaining still produce a high quality product as outlined in my original proposal and deliver this high quality product on time!</p>

                <p>The original intention for a portion of the Spiderwick Chronicles was for an X shaped seesaw in a forest clearing.  The first pitch from the team was for a puzzle where the player would need to place a rock on one end of the seesaw to gain access to another area, and place weights on a second of the 4 ends to gain access to the final area to bypass the puzzle.</p>
                <p>I suggested, and created basic design documentation for a brief underground maze followed by a chase sequence featuring an underused boss in an underground cavern leaping across islands of rock jutting out above a chasm of impossible depth with the camera turning around to face the player keeping the pursuing monster in view reinforcing the urgency.</p>
                <p>Here you can see the fantastic results of the level designers, music artist, environment artists, character modelers and animators.</p>
