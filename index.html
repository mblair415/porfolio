        <p>Teachers And Students Connecting or TASC is a project I created with an extremely talented team of fellow students.  We realized that some of the resources for tracking class assignments, submitted work, and feedback provided on that work was spread out across many different software systems.  We wanted to go through the process of attempting to fix a very real problem by trying to consolidate these tracking systems into a single location and we also wanted to make sure we identified the needs of both the teaching staff and the students. I’m extremely proud of what we were able to accomplish in a week!</p>

          <p>My role on the team was that of a team member wearing many hats.  I created controllers, models, and views providing the ability to create, read, edit, and destroy resources.  I also worked to ensure that these options were displayed on the screen in a way that was not only clear, but worked within the general style of our school, General Assembly, specifically because we wanted the site to resemble a school resource and we chose to follow their style guidelines rather than making something that looked and felt like a separate experience.  Lasty, relying on previous work experience, I helped by functioning as a supervising project manager allowing other team members to stretch their legs at creating the schedule, breaking down tasks and communicating needs and I tried to speak up minimally to call attention to potential risks I had identified and help the group work to achieve a solution before the problem arose in full.  I’m extremely proud of what our team accomplished in such a short period of time and I’m very proud of my contributions with the group.</p>

        <p>Our user is a tech savvy sandwich aficionado. Someone who won’t be fooled by any questionable piece of meat sitting lacklusterly between a pair of tired old buns. No! Our user expects the greatest culinary experience offered. But, the question remains, where to get it? Where’s their club, their open face, their BLAT ... where’s their hero?</p>
        <p>That's where we come in. We host reviews of sandwiches to help our users find the best usage of their food oriented face holes. We find their hero and we tell them right where to shove it!</p>
